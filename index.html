                She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an "L" on her forehead </p>

        <p class="paragraph"> Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do, so much to see
                So what's wrong with taking the back streets? You'll never know if you don't go You'll never shine if you don't glow</p>
