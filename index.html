        <p class="paragraph">Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
                She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an "L" on her forehead </p>
            <br>
        <p class="paragraph"> Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do, so much to see
                So what's wrong with taking the back streets? You'll never know if you don't go You'll never shine if you don't glow</p>
            <br>
        <p class="paragraph"> Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
                And all that glitters is gold. Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
            <br>
        <p class="paragraph"> It's a cool place and they say it gets colder You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
                But the meteor men beg to differ Judging by the hole in the satellite picture The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
                The water's getting warm so you might as well swim My world's on fire, how about yours? That's the way I like it and I never get bored</p>
